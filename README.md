# EC601_Resume
Build your own resume website. 

I use the jumbotron-narrow template for my resume websit.

For the second step, the link of the friendly chat is https://friendlychat-ed789.firebaseapp.com

And the link of the chat is also in my resume at the top right corner.

For the files, the web-start are the files for friendly chat, the firebase project. The resume.html is my resume web page, and the resume.png is the screen shot for my web page.
